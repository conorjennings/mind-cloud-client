## About the app

mindCloud is a clean and simple way to manage brilliance. Afraid you will forget an important idea? Throw it in the cloud! Create and edit ideas as the evolve, or simply delete them if they no longer serve you.

### How it works

### Wireframes and Models

### User Stories

 - As a creative person with lots of ideas, I want a quick and simple way to capture a thought so that I can return to it later if it's truly of value to me.
 - As a user, I want to be able to quickly remove thoughts/ideas that I no longer need.
 - As a user, I want my ideas to display cleanly on any device I use.
 - As a user, I don't want other people to have access to my ideas.

### Stretch Goals

  - (COMPLETED) Incorporate at least one Node.js module directly rather than through CDN.
  - (COMPLETED) Design the app to look good on all devices using responsive design elements.
  - Support the ability to add links a user wants to revisit. Rather than text, a link preview would render to screen.
  - Create a simple unit test that validate high level functionality to support continuous integration methodology.

### Unsolved Issues

 - Introduced a hover effect that highlights ideas as you mouse over them. It should work on touch mobile phones, but I don't reliably see the effect when using the app from my mobile device.
